## sp25-create-doohickey

This module is to create/access a folder and create a JavaScript file with a custom name. If the file name is already used within the folder, it will not create a new file. At the moment it can only go one folder deep, however there is possible plans to allow for the module to go multiple files deep.

### How to use

Once the module has been installed, you will need to follow these steps:
 1. Use "npm start" within the terminal
 2. When prompted, type in the name of the folder that you would like to create or access
 3. When prompted, type in the name of the file that you would like to create
